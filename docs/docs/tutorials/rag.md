## What's RAG?

## What's the point of RAG?

## How is RAG different from search?

## RAG vs fine-tuning

### Advantages of RAG

* Changes to information
* Auth and permissions

### Limitations of RAG

* Foundational vs retrieved knowledge (ie, knowing when to RAG)
* Context length
* Retrieval quality

### Example of RAG vs fine-tuning

NBA roster.

Show 1000 fine-tuning runs to update the player roster, and show the log probs of each player.
Vs RAG, where you can just retrieve the player roster from a DB.
